| November 27 | 6:30-7:30 | On the flight back, I went through the slides for the problem set and the reading that was given to remember the algorithm that we were given. From there, I went to start on the compress algorithm which went smoothly besides thinking through what should happen when there is more than 255 in a row. However, after thinking it through I understood that the currentRun should be reset to 1 not 0, because technically you have found a new value, that you just write in the currentRun like normal but then you also need to write in a a 0 so that the code knows that it's a repeat. From there, the expand was much easier after doing the compress by just reading in the 8-bit chunk, reading the 0s/1s in and flipping the pattern bit. Although, I still am having issues figuring out how to run my code, I'm pretty sure it should work. |

Then, when I ran it for the first time the original and final output had differences. When I went back through my code I realized that when I reset my currentRun to 0 that was incorrect because you are actually at the start of a new run after going into that loop so technically you have to set currentRun to 1. After I made that fix my code worked great. |
